## Architecture

This frontend is part of a decoupled architecture:

- Frontend (this repo) - Hosted on Netlify
- [Backend API](link-to-backend-repo) - Separate Flask application

### API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend through these endpoints:

- `GET /` - Fetch paginated posts
- `GET /post/{id}` - Fetch single post
- `POST /create` - Create new post

## Deployment

This project is configured for continuous deployment with Netlify:

1. Push to `main` branch triggers deployment
2. Netlify builds and serves the static files
3. API calls are made to the production backend
